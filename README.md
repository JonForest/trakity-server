# Trakity Server
This is the Django API server, able to support multiple types of client (e.g. ember, command-line etc)

## Build Locally

## How to run tests

## Deploy to server

# TODO items
* Copy over pieces of trakity code from the original
* Get tasks with hard coded user working
* Get user login working. See if I can replicate, without copying, the token based mechanism that AQ uses
